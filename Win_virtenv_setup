Install python 2.6.3
Create a virtual environment for it
Download scapy source, install it with your virtual environment
Install winpcap
**pywin32 install will most likely require a visual studio install for the compiler**
Download pywin32 source, install it with your virtual environment
**EDIT WINDOWS REGISTRY TO REGISTER THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT**
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Python\PythonCore\2.6
    InstallPath and PythonPath
Download and install special pypcap and libdnet binaries, install to the registered virtual environment
Download and install pyreadline binary, install to virtual environment
**Revert Windows Registry to register raw Python2.6 (OPTIONAL)**

C:\Virt\Scapy\python.exe
>> from scapy.all import *

This might throw a bunch of errors, if it does, do the following:
Find where scapy is installed to (site-packages)
    C:\VirtualEnvs\Scapy\Lib\site-packages\scapy
Edit scapy\layers\inet6.py line 3006 to
    bind_layers(IPv6,      IP,       nh = 4 )

At this point it might still throw a warning about IPv6, and a warning
about ipsec IPPROTO_AH, it apparently doesn't matter though
